# Fungal-spores
Done with unity for Buutti GameJam by three people with no previous experience in game development or C#. Please note! This project was done with very limited time.

Gameplay: 
You are a mushroom, bouncing on mushrooms, shooting mushrooms and you can also click to add tiny mushrooms. There are these ominous black blobs, that don't really do anything, except multiply occasionally. You can also fly by bouncing on the tiny mushrooms you spawn by clicking. Eventually lag wins.
